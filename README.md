# test_webshop_public
This is a hobbi project, a test webshop written in Blazor. Whereas there are functions to add in the future, it is entirely working with every base function needed for a MVP.

Contains basic CRUD and many quality of life features with an advanced admin panel. Also contains a test stripe payment.

The database is empty, but you can fill it up on the site via the admin panel.

In the appsettings you should provide your own smtp email and your stripe keys before testing.

Default admin login:
admin@webshop.hu
Admin123!
